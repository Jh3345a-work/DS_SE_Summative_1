# DS_SE_Summative_1
A repo for my Summative 1 assignment for the Software Engineering module (2000 words +- 10%).

# Assessment Task:

## Propose
Propose a new prdouct for your employer or a small-scale side proejct for yourself or your team. It may be either:
- (a) A simple web app (written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
- (b) A data product, for example, a Jupyter notebook with data visualisations that collect data from a web API or an online SQL database.

## Design and Prototype
The link to the prototype NOMIS Population Estimates App can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/mkHJsps61uHcKIPIVSwEMh/SE_Summative_1?node-id=0-1&t=jPzamB5Tra5ZRfd9-1)

## Plan
Plan your project using modern planning techinques (Agile with sprints). Use project management tool (GitHub Projects). Add a dedication section to your README that shows how you have used your project management tools.

## Capture
Capture the requirements for your project as issues (aka tickets) accessible via your chosen project management tool.

## Build
Build a minimal viable product (MVP) or prototype step by step, and have a dedicated section in the README that narrates the process.

## TDD
Use Test Driven Development to produce some of the codebase for your product and set up CI/CD (for example, GitHub Actions).

## Iterative Development
Use GitHub or an alternative to add features to your MVP or prototype gradually.

## Document
Document your MVP with both user and technical documentation. The user documentation should guide end users on how to use your app, while the technical documentation should explain the code, how to run the application locally, and how to conduct tests.

## Maintain
Maintain the ticketing system to keep the documentation up to date. Conventionally, one ticket corresponds to one feature, which in turn corresponds to one branch and one pull request. Bug tickets are documented differently from feature tickets.

## Evaluate
Evaluate your product in a dedicated "Evaluation" section of your README.

# Submission
- Non-anonymous. Submit a link to your GitHub repo, ensuring it is public.
- Additionally, submit a PDF of your REAME in the rooot of the Canvas submission.
- Finally, submit a ZIP folder downloaded from your GitHub repo.
