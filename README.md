# Data Science Software Engineering Summative 1 Assignment
This repository contains all the files and information relevant to my Summative 1 assignment for the Software Engineering module.

## Project Proposal
The proposal for this project is to create a useful data product. Specifically, this product will be a Jupyter notebook which connects to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) NOMIS web API to collect UK regional population estimates and convert this data into three standardised, publication ready charts. 
The charts selected to be included in this Jupyter notebook will be a bar chart displaying the population of each region within the United Kingdom using data from 2023, a pie chart displaying the population breakdown of each region in 2024, and a second bar chart highlighting the percentage change in each region between 2023 and 2024.
This product has been selected as NOMIS is beginning to be utilised by my workplace and this product could act as an introduction to senior stakeholders and decisions makers about the usefulness and potential of this API.


## Design and Prototype
The NOMIS Population Estimates prototype is available [here]( https://www.figma.com/design/mkHJsps61uHcKIPIVSwEMh/SE_Summative_1?node-id=3-252&t=jPzamB5Tra5ZRfd9-1). 

This design uses four separate frames for the Landing Page, Bar Chart, Pie Chart, and Percentage Change Chart. These pages use an embedded PNG file exported from  the Jupyter notebook, including the 2023 Regional Breakdown bar chart, 2024 Regional Breakdown pie chart, and percentage point change in population share from 2023 to 2024. A consistent image of my organisation’s logo appears on every frame to reflect the intended product branding. Additionally, each of the buttons within the prototype are wired to allow the user to click through the fully functional prototype.
The design of this prototype also utilised user feedback. After the initial design had been created, a google form containing questions around key design features was distributed to the 5 other members within my team. The resulting changes included a reordering of the Landing page buttons into a vertical stack, rather than horizontal. A rework of the “% Change Chart” name to “Percentage Chart Chart” was also introduced, and a visible button to export each page to a PNG file was also included. This contribution helped to integrate user feedback and improved the overall prototype by aligning the prototype more closely with stakeholder expectations, and make the application more user-friendly.

An example of the google form can be found [here]( https://forms.gle/bS94FHrxhvVtbxLJA).


## Plan
Plan your project using modern planning techinques (Agile with sprints). Use project management tool (GitHub Projects). Add a dedication section to your README that shows how you have used your project management tools.


## Capture
Capture the requirements for your project as issues (aka tickets) accessible via your chosen project management tool.


## Build
Build a minimal viable product (MVP) or prototype step by step, and have a dedicated section in the README that narrates the process.


## TDD
Use Test Driven Development to produce some of the codebase for your product and set up CI/CD (for example, GitHub Actions).


## Iterative Development
Use GitHub or an alternative to add features to your MVP or prototype gradually.


## Document
Document your MVP with both user and technical documentation. The user documentation should guide end users on how to use your app, while the technical documentation should explain the code, how to run the application locally, and how to conduct tests.


## Maintain
Maintain the ticketing system to keep the documentation up to date. Conventionally, one ticket corresponds to one feature, which in turn corresponds to one branch and one pull request. Bug tickets are documented differently from feature tickets.


## Evaluate
Evaluate your product in a dedicated "Evaluation" section of your README.


# Submission
- Non-anonymous. Submit a link to your GitHub repo, ensuring it is public.
- Additionally, submit a PDF of your REAME in the rooot of the Canvas submission.
- Finally, submit a ZIP folder downloaded from your GitHub repo.
